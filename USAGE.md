2. Select **Groq** as API provider
3. Paste your API key
4. Click **Save Settings**

## Create Your First Deck (1 minute)

1. Click **New Deck**
2. Name it: "Test Deck"
3. Click **Create Deck**

## Generate Cards (2 minutes)

1. In your Test Deck, paste this sample text:

```
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create oxygen and energy in the form of sugar. The process occurs in chloroplasts, which contain chlorophyll - the green pigment that gives plants their color. There are two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. The light reactions convert light energy into chemical energy (ATP and NADPH), while the Calvin cycle uses that energy to convert CO2 into glucose.
```

2. Set number of cards: **5**
3. Click **Generate Flashcards**
4. Wait 10-20 seconds

## Study Session (3 minutes)

1. Click **Study Now**
2. Listen to the question
3. Think of your answer (10 second pause)
4. Listen to the correct answer
5. Rate yourself:
   - Press **Ctrl+1** if you got it wrong (Again)
   - Press **Ctrl+2** if it was hard
   - Press **Ctrl+3** if you got it right (Good)
   - Press **Ctrl+4** if it was easy
6. Next card plays automatically!

## Example Study Materials

### Biology Example
```
The cell membrane is a semi-permeable barrier composed of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins. It controls what enters and exits the cell through various transport mechanisms including passive diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and active transport. The fluid mosaic model describes how the membrane components are arranged, with proteins floating in or across the lipid bilayer like icebergs in a sea.
```
**Suggested cards**: 6-8

### History Example
```
The Renaissance was a period of cultural rebirth in Europe from the 14th to 17th century. It began in Italy and spread throughout Europe. Key characteristics included renewed interest in classical Greek and Roman culture, humanist philosophy emphasizing individual potential, advancements in art with realistic perspective and anatomy, and scientific inquiry challenging medieval beliefs. Important figures include Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Galileo.
```
**Suggested cards**: 8-10

### Programming Example
```
Python functions are defined using the 'def' keyword followed by the function name and parentheses. Parameters are listed inside the parentheses, and the function body is indented. Functions can return values using the 'return' keyword. Lambda functions provide a way to create small anonymous functions. Decorators are functions that modify the behavior of other functions, denoted with @ symbol.
```
**Suggested cards**: 7-9

## Hotkey Reference

During study sessions:

| Key | Action | When to Use |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| `Ctrl+1` | Again | You completely forgot |
| `Ctrl+2` | Hard | You struggled to remember |
| `Ctrl+3` | Good | You remembered correctly |
| `Ctrl+4` | Easy | It was very easy |

## Tips

### For Best AI Generation:
- Use 500-1500 words of clear text
- Academic or textbook content works best
- Generate 10-20 cards at a time
- Avoid very short snippets (< 200 words)
- Don't use messy/unstructured notes

### For Effective Studying:
- Study daily - even just 5-10 minutes
- Use hotkeys for speed
- Be honest with ratings
- Edit cards that don't make sense
- Study while multitasking (cooking, exercising, etc.)

### For ADHD/Multitaskers:
- Listen mode allows you to study hands-free
- Auto-advance keeps you engaged
- Short 10-second intervals maintain focus
- Hotkeys reduce cognitive load of clicking
- Works great during: walking, cleaning, driving (be careful!), exercising

## Common Workflows

### Exam Prep
1. Upload lecture notes or textbook PDF
2. Generate 30-50 cards per chapter
3. Edit/review generated cards
4. Study 20-30 minutes daily
5. Cards automatically scheduled by algorithm

### Language Learning
1. Paste vocabulary lists or grammar rules
2. Generate translation/definition cards
3. Study during commute or chores
4. Rate based on recall speed

### Certification/Test Prep
1. Extract content from study guides
2. Generate 100+ cards over multiple sessions
3. Daily review of due cards
4. Difficult cards appear more frequently

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

**Problem**: "No cards due to study"
- Solution: Wait for cards to be due, or generate more cards

**Problem**: Hotkeys not working
- Solution: Run app as administrator (Windows) or grant permissions (Mac)
- Alternative: Click buttons instead

**Problem**: AI generates weird cards
- Solution: Edit or delete them before studying
- Tip: Provide clearer/more structured source text

**Problem**: "API Error"
- Check API key is correct
- Verify you have API credits remaining
- Try different AI provider

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable:
1. Create separate decks for different subjects
2. Upload full PDFs for comprehensive card generation
3. Adjust hotkeys to your preference
4. Study regularly - the algorithm works best with daily use!
